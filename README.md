# Analyzing-Risk-Behaviors-in-Youth
Risky behaviors are acts that increase the risk of disease or injury, which could eventually threaten health or even life. Especially, potentially risky behaviors that youths engage in will impact their well-being and life prospects. Activities such as smoking, consuming alcohol, having sex, and taking drugs will cause consequences for the remainder of their lives. Therefore, our group would like to gain a better understanding of youth risk behavior patterns and draw insights that can help teenagers create lifelong healthy behaviors. Our project builds a surveillance system that analyzes three categories of health risk behavior among the youth:

<p>1. Alcoholism and drug abuse</p>
<p>2. Unhealthy Sexual Behavior</p>
<p>3. Tobacco Usage</p>
   
We obtained a data set, which contains 2,740,200 rows and 35 columns of observations, from Kaggle. It is about a Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) that conducts surveys to collect information from high school students in terms of adverse health behaviors in over 100 schools in the United States. The survey data ranges from 1991 to 2017 and associates a risk percentage to specific health-related issues over various demographic categories such as race, grade, sex, and location.

Based on the data set, we come up with some meaningful questions and would like to explore more:

Is there an increase in tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use among youth over the years in different regions and states of the United States of America?
(We aim to determine if drug use behaviors including consuming alcohol, marijuana, heroin, or ecstasy increased over years in different states across the US. We look for the change of trend in drug use behaviors and how it differs in terms of the type of drug, years, and states.)

Which student demographics are susceptible to different substance abuse and sexual behaviors?
(We want to check if there is any relationship between different demographics and risky behaviors. We would like to see how sex, grade, race, and location may influence the youth's tendency to engage in drug use and sexual behaviors. )

Does excessive alcohol/drug abuse lead to higher chances of sexually transmitted diseases among high school students?
(We plan to determine whether the alcohol or drug use behavior will cause a higher likelihood of engaging in sexual behaviors which may further increase sexually transmitted diseases among youth. We try to determine whether there is a relationship between those risky behaviors and if yes what type of correlation coefficient exists.)

How does the risky behavior among youth in different grades change over the years? Is there any significant pattern in risky behavior over the years for high school girls and boys?
(We intend to determine the trend of engaging in risky behaviors in different high school grades in recent two decades. Also, we would like to check if teens in different genders show different risky behavior patterns.)

By analyzing the dataset, we will be able to find some helpful relationships between behaviors and experiences among high school students and figure out the change patterns of risky behaviors over time and place. Based on that, we can provide some insights and suggestions on how to enhance the current law enforcement and improve legal regulations to prevent high school students from engaging in risky behaviors. Furthermore, our system will prove beneficial for giving guidance to various non-profit organizations on helping and protecting at-risk young adults and teenagers in the United States.
